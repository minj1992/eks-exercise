setup env variable as user in the same terminal where youare are building the code --->

You're on the right track trying to set environment variables in PowerShell!
However, the way you wrote it has a small syntax issue: you need to separate the statements line by line — you can't chain them together with just spaces.

Here’s the correct way to set those environment variables on Windows 10 using PowerShell:

powershell
Copy
Edit
$env:USERNAME = "testuser"
$env:PASSWORD = "testpassword"
$env:TOKEN = "abc123"
$env:SERVER = "prod-server"
Notes:

This sets the environment variables for the current PowerShell session only.
Once you close the PowerShell window, they will be gone.

If you want to permanently set environment variables in Windows (for all sessions), you can do it like this:

powershell
Copy
Edit
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('USERNAME', 'testuser', 'User')
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('PASSWORD', 'testpassword', 'User')
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('TOKEN', 'abc123', 'User')
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('SERVER', 'prod-server', 'User')
'User' scope means it will be saved for the current user permanently (even after reboot).

You can also use 'Machine' if you want it system-wide (requires administrator rights)
